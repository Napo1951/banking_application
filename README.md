<h2>Brief Description</h2>
<p>This is a Bank application (Final project) that I have build with the support of MIT xPRO. It will show a series of process: 
  Create Account -- multiple users are able to signup by entering name, email and password (8 characters are more;
  Login -- after character creation, you could use both email and password to log in;
  Deposit -- You may test it by deposit any amount greater than $0 to see if the message will show that it was a success or not;
  Withdraw -- same as the deposit, users can test it by withdrawing amount greater than $0; however, over the balance will pop-up a message and will not let you go over your limit;
  Balance -- this is the area once you made a deposit and/or withdrawn, you'll be able to see the amounts;
  All Data -- is where all informations are stored once you login, deposit and/or withdrawn to keep track of.</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>You will be able to navigate through this project to test the deposit, withdraw and inspect the other areas. If you attempt to put a negative amount, it will be rejected. If you attempt to withdraw more than the available balance, it will denied the withdrawal</p>
<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>A lot can be add to this application because banking itself is unlimited, such as other types of account and other services like online trabsfer, send money (Zelle or Cash App), Pay Bills, online Deposit. 
We can also add an early pay day, if customers are enroll in direct deposit, we can also add extra time if account overdraw, and finally Data to track customer's spending.</p>
<h2>How to run</h2>
<p>You can click the link https://napo1951.github.io/Stephane-NapoleonBakingApplication/ to test it out. Also, you can pull it to your system by following this steps:
Open your command-line (GitBash)
Type "cd desktop"
Type "mkdir Bad-Bank" (to create a folder in your desktop) or any other names you want to name it
Type "git clone https://github.com/Napo1951/Stephane-NapoleonBakingApplication.git"
Type http-server -c-1
You'll be able to navigate on server 127.0.0.1:8080 to test this application.</p>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
